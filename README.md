# ðŸŽ¥ AI-Based Video Recommendation System

This project is a simplified **YouTube-style AI recommendation system** built using **JavaScript (Node.js)**. It suggests videos to users based on their **watch history**, simulating how real-world platforms like YouTube or Netflix personalize content for each viewer.

Unlike traditional static content lists, this system **dynamically recommends** videos by analyzing:
- What a user has watched before
- Video categories/tags
- Similar users' behaviors (collaborative filtering)

The project helps demonstrate core recommendation system techniques such as:
- **Content-based filtering** (recommending videos with similar tags)
- **User-based collaborative filtering** (recommending what similar users watched)
- **Jaccard similarity** for measuring user similarity based on watch history

It's a great starting point to understand how modern recommendation engines work and can be extended to include likes, watch duration, and search terms.
